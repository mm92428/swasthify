## How is our solution different

-   Our solution is different in an umpteen number of ways. It's a user-to-hospital interaction without any third-party involvement.
-   The ordeal which was at display during the second wave, due to data inadequacy manifested the need for an application where a user can access the real-time data updated by hospitals related to all emergency services, vaccines, etc.
-   Our application works in a similar way where a hospital gets to update the aforementioned services on its dashboard.
-   When a user logs in he gets to see the real-time changes made by hospitals, and thus he gets an articulated and pragmatic display of all the services offered by different hospitals all across the country.
-   Booking services using our application will also be an advantage as that would save users from unnecessary wobbling between hospitals.

## Future Possible Enhancements
-   Providing users the option to book a variety of services that the hospitals offer.
-   A prescription catalogue, from where a user can keep track of all his past prescriptions.
-   A doctor's clinic where a user can consult any registered doctor from across the country.

## Installation
- npm install
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
